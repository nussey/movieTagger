The Tagger app is the one that creates the command line and runs atomic parsley. It basically reads in a list of movies and executes the proper tagging based on the movies.xml file in the movie's directory. You can see examples of this in any of our movie directories.

One simple optimization would be to use a library that reads XML natively rather than the manual parsing I did (VB has built-in XML parsing but it's a mess to learn so I punted)
